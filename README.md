## Features

This app allows moderators to be notified by private message whenever a user replies to a bot, such as the [subreddit]-ModTeam account.

- Define a list of bot accounts to monitor.
- Message all mods individually with bot reply notifications.
- Define a blocklist of mods you don't want to message (e.g., bots).
- Define an allowlist of users to message which would override the mod list and could also include non-mod users.
- Ignore comment replies from mods.
- Optionally enable messaging for replies to bot posts in addition to bot comments.

**Note:** To ensure proper functionality of this app, mods should explicitly allow the bot account (u/bot-reply-msg) to contact them privately. This can be accomplished using the following steps.

On desktop:

1. Click your profile picture, then settings.
2. Go to the Privacy tab and click on "Who can send you chat requests."
3. Type the username: bot-reply-msg
4. Press Enter

On mobile (instructions for iOS, but should be possible on Android as well):

1. Tap your profile picture, then Settings.
2. Tap your username under Account Settings.
3. Tap on Chat Permissions under Safety.
4. Tap on Allow List and type the username: bot-reply-msg
5. Tap on the Add button next to the appropriate search result.
